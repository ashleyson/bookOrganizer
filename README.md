# bookOrganizer
A program used to organize Book's author names (in lexicographical / alphabetical order).
In the event of a tie (several books are written by the same author), the published year will be used to determine the Book object’s place.
If the author and year published are the same, 
then the Book’s title (lexicographical / alphabetical order) will be used to determine the Book object’s place
